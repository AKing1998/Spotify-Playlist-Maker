# Spotify-Playlist-Maker
A Web App that will automatically curate a Spotify playlist 
for you based on queries your provide so that you don't have 
to mannually go and make one.    

##  Pipeline:


~~We can do two things at the moment. One is to create lots of 
empty playlist in my account and add songs to that playlist
and share the playlist.~~ It is strikedthrough because I would need to save the log in session of the admin somehow 
for the user to access admins playlists.

The other option is to make the person sign in and select their own playlist that they will edit and songs will be 
added to that playlist. 
If it is possible to make an empty playlist then it is okay
